# Excel-statistical-analysis

## Project Overview

This Excel project demonstrates various statistical analysis techniques using a combination of real-world and hypothetical datasets. The goal is to showcase my proficiency in handling and interpreting data to gain valuable insights.

## Sheet Descriptions

### Descriptive Statistics:
Provides a comprehensive overview of the used car prices dataset, including measures of central tendency, dispersion, and distribution.
Utilizes functions like:
Mean, Median, Mode
Standard Deviation, Variance
Range, Minimum, Maximum
Quantiles (e.g., Lower Quartile, Upper Quartile)

### ANOVA Analysis:
Examines the relationship between drivetrain type and fuel efficiency in the used car prices dataset.
Employs ANOVA to determine if there are significant differences in fuel efficiency across different drivetrain categories.

### Time Series Analysis:
Analyzes the red deer population data from 1990 to 2023 using base ratios and chain-linked indices.
Calculates base ratios to measure relative changes in population and chain-linked indices to adjust for structural changes over time.

### Contingency Table Analysis:
Examines the association between changes in the big game population in 1990 and 2023.
Creates contingency tables and calculates measures of association like chi-square.

### Revenue Analysis:
Analyzes the impact of price, volume, and value index on hypothetical business revenue between 2022 and 2023.
Calculates revenue, analyzes trends, and explores potential correlations.
